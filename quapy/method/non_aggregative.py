    minimizing the average divergence (in terms of the Hellinger Distance) across the feature-specific normalized
    histograms of two representations, one for the unlabelled examples, and another generated from the training
    examples as a mixture model of the class-specific representations. The parameters of the mixture thus represent
    the estimates of the class prevalence values. The method computes all matchings for nbins in [10, 20, ..., 110]
